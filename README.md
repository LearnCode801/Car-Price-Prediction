## Overview

The **Car Price Prediction App** is a machine learning application developed to predict the resale price of cars based on various features such as car age, kilometers driven, fuel type, and transmission. Using a linear regression model, this app provides an interface for users to input car details and get a predicted selling price. This project offers a practical example of building an end-to-end machine learning solution, including data processing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the car dataset for training by handling null values and transforming features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation and encoding of relevant features for model optimization.
- **Model Building**: Training machine learning models, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, with comparative analysis.
- **Deployment**: A Flask-based web interface that enables user interaction with the model for real-time price predictions.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Ensures clean and consistent data through preprocessing techniques.
- **Feature Selection**: Focus on essential features like car age, fuel type, and transmission type for accurate predictions.
- **Web Application**: User-friendly interface for non-technical users.
- **Real-time Predictions**: Input car details to receive an instant predicted price.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Flask
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LearnCode801/Car-Price-Prediction.git
cd Car-Price-Prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook `End to End - Car Price Prediction App - Project 5.ipynb` for a step-by-step walkthrough of the data analysis, feature engineering, and model training.
2. Start the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

3. Open `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser to access the app and input car details for price predictions.

## Results

The app predicts the selling price of a car based on user inputs, helping car owners understand the estimated market value of their vehicles.
